In this project I...

- Created a weather app than provides real-time data for any location in the
  world.
- Accessed an API to gather this data, processed it to gather nessecary details, and then displayed those details.
- Included the ability to toggle between the imperial and metric systems for the data displayed, both allowing for the option to be toggled before the search was made, and for the data to be toggled after already displayed.
- Update the display based on data received from the API fetch request.
